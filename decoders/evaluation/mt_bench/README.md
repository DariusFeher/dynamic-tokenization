This folder contains the gen_model_answer.py file we used for MT-Bench evaluation. The rest of the files remained unchanged.
MT-Bench scripts as well as steps for running the benchmark can be found [here](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat).

To run the MT-Bench experiments in decoders replace the original gen_model_answer.py file in FastChat with the modified one.
